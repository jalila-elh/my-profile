    <h1> Hello,I'm Jalila</h1>
     <img src="images/jprofile.jpeg" alt="jalila elh" class="img-circle">
    <p> I am in my fifth year as a financial engineering student, during my academic career, I studied a variety of courses that have given me the knowledge I know I need to be successful in the finance field. I was fortunate to have the opportunity to learn about macroeconomics, microeconomics, personal finance, project management, business, accounting, risuqe management and Financial Decision-Making. I am an individual who pays very close attention to detail. I have the ability to solve complex financial issues, and I possess strong analytical skills. My oral and written communication skills are stellar. I perform well in fast-paced environments.
